# Industrial Kuka Robot 7-DOF Programming Project

This project is designed for the Position-based kinematics for 7-DoF serial manipulators with global configuration control, joint limit and singularity avoidance



## Usage
The optimum kinematic design for a 7 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) serial manipulator as an alternative to 6 or less DoF manipulators, which have known difficulties overcoming obstructed workspaces and singu- larities. Due to their structural advantages in task performance, or to their human-likeness, 7-DoF serial manipulators are a trending subject with application over a wide range of research fields. Seven DoF manipulators are often referred to as redundant because the target pose is usually specified in task-space in three position and three orientation variables, which renders the inverse kinematics problem under-constrained.
